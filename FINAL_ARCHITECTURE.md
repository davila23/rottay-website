# ROTTAY - Final Architecture

## The Vision
**Minimal content. Maximum visual impact.**
3D visualizations that represent AI infrastructure and data flow.

## Visual Language

### Hero: Neural Network Visualization
- 3D neural network with glowing nodes
- Data flowing through connections
- Interactive - responds to mouse movement
- Glass morphism panels floating in space
- Gradient orbs (blue to purple) representing AI models

### Products: Floating Glass Cards
- Each product as a 3D glass panel
- Holographic effect on hover
- Data particles flowing between them
- Connected by glowing lines showing integration

### Technology Stack: 3D Layer Diagram  
- Stacked glass layers showing our stack
- Each layer interactive and expandable
- Real-time code snippets appearing
- Particles representing data flow

## 3D Components to Build

### 1. Neural Network Globe
- Sphere of interconnected nodes
- Pulsing data through connections
- Gradient materials (black glass + neon edges)
- Responds to mouse position
- WebGL shaders for glow effects

### 2. Floating Panels System
- Glass morphism material
- Refraction and reflection
- Soft shadows
- Parallax depth
- Smooth spring animations

### 3. Data Particles
- GPU particles system
- Flow between components
- Represent real-time data
- Color coded by type
- 10,000+ particles

### 4. Holographic Interfaces
- Translucent panels
- Chromatic aberration
- Scan line effects
- Depth of field blur
- Noise textures

## Color Palette
```
Background:    #000000 (Pure black)
Glass:         #FFFFFF10 (10% white)
Accents:       #00D4FF (Cyan)
               #8B5CF6 (Purple)  
               #EC4899 (Pink)
Text:          #FFFFFF (Pure white)
Secondary:     #666666 (Gray)
```

## Typography
```
Display:  Inter Tight - 72px
Heading:  Inter - 32px
Body:     Inter - 16px
Code:     JetBrains Mono - 14px
```

## Animations
- Everything floats slightly (breathing effect)
- Smooth camera movements
- Particle systems always active
- Glow pulses on interactions
- No sudden movements

## Performance Optimization
- LOD (Level of Detail) for 3D objects
- Frustum culling
- Texture atlasing
- GPU instancing for particles
- Progressive enhancement

## Implementation Stack

### 3D Engine
```javascript
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- React Three Fiber for React integration
- Drei for helpers and abstractions
- Custom GLSL shaders
- Post-processing pipeline
```

### Interactions
```javascript
- Framer Motion for 2D animations
- Leva for debug controls (dev only)
- GSAP for complex timelines
- Intersection Observer for triggers
```

### Architecture
```javascript
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- Static export for performance
- Edge deployment
- WebGL fallbacks
- Canvas recording for social sharing
```

## The Experience

Users don't read about our technology.
They see it. They feel it. They interact with it.

Every scroll reveals new layers.
Every hover triggers responses.
Every click provides feedback.

This isn't a website.
It's a visualization of our capabilities.

**Simple content. Complex visuals. Zero bullshit.**

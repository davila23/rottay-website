#### Functional Requirements:

➤ Led the Design and Development of a Notification System aimed at centralizing communication with users in a single Service. Prior to this project, different micro-services were communicating with the user, sometimes triggering multiple notifications without proper logs.  
➤ Survey and document all sub-systems that interact with users via App (Push Notification) or Email (AWS SNS) and incorporate them into the solution provided. Worked closely with various teams to ensure a smooth transition to production and the replacement of each code fragment.

#### Realized tasks:

» Coordinated and delegated team tasks to ensure timely and efficient completion of project deliverables.  
» Documented the system's architecture and integrations carried out, which involved creating comprehensive technical documentation that outlined the Notification System's design, implementation, and functionality.  
» Collaborated with different departments within the company to transfer responsibility for sending notifications to users to the centralized Notification System

#### Technologies used:

Java / AWS SQS / AWS SNS / Jenkins / MongoDB / Jira Management Tool / Datadog / Docker / Bash / AWS DynamoDB / AWS RDS / AWS S3 / AWS Cloudfront.

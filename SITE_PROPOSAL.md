## Design Principles

### Typography
- One font family (Inter)
- Two weights only (Regular, Bold)
- Three sizes (64px, 24px, 16px)

### Colors
- Black text on white
- White text on black
- Gray for secondary (#666)
- Beige for accents (#F5F2ED)

### Layout
- Single column
- Generous white space
- No sidebars
- No cards
- No icons

### Interactions
- Hover: Simple underline
- Click: Instant response
- Scroll: Smooth, no parallax
- Loading: None (static site)

### What Makes It Modern
- Extreme minimalism
- Focus on typography
- No decorative elements
- Fast as hell
- Mobile-first

## Technical Implementation

### Performance
- Static HTML
- No JavaScript where possible
- System fonts
- < 50KB total page weight
- Edge cached

### SEO
- Semantic HTML
- Proper meta tags
- Structured data
- Fast Core Web Vitals

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigable
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast
- No animations by default

## Content Voice

### What we say:
- "We build X"
- "Live now"
- "Coming Q1 2025"
- "Miami Beach, FL"

### What we DON'T say:
- "Revolutionary"
- "Industry-leading"
- "Cutting-edge"
- "Transform your business"
- "Request a demo"

## The Vibe

Think:
- Stripe's clarity
- Linear's precision
- Vercel's minimalism
- None of their marketing BS

This is a site that says:
"We're too busy building great software to make a fancy website."

And that's the point.
